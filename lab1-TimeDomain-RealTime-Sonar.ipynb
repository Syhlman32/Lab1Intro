    "The detection resolution and sensitivity will depend on the parameters you will choose for the sonar. The longer the pulse is, the worse time resolution you will get, but much stronger matched filtering amplitude. You can get back time resolution by using pulse compression with chirp pulses at the expense of increasing the bandwidth. \n",

You can get interesting targets by moving your Pi, moving yourself next to the Pi, using a book as a reflecting surface, etc. It will be easier for you to distinguish the target if you move it back and forth. Play with the pulse lengths, the frequency sweeps, etc. \n",
